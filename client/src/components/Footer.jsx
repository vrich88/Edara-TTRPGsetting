        <p>This site is built for sharing the Edara TTRPG setting with my friends with no intentions of monetization. We
            use material from multiple TTRPG settings, systems, and creators to homebrew our shared gaming experience.
            Therefore, any people or corporations trying to claim ownership and rights can suck it.</p>
